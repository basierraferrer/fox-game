# Fox Game

This project is a virtual pet game where you take care of a virtual fox. You can feed it, clean up after it, change the weather, and more!

## Getting Started

To get started with the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/basierraferrer/fox-game.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `cd fox-game && yarn install`
3. Run the development server: `yarn dev`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:1234`

## How to Play

Once the game is running, you can interact with the virtual fox using the buttons on the screen. Here are the available actions:

- **Weather Icon**: Clicking this icon will change the weather in the game.
- **Poop Icon**: Clicking this icon will clean up the fox's poop.
- **Fish Icon**: Clicking this icon will feed the fox.

The game also has different states and events that affect the gameplay. The fox can be in various states like sleeping, hungry, celebrating, etc. These states change over time, and you need to take appropriate actions to keep the fox happy and healthy.
